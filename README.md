## :star: Introduction 

Growing up, one of my favourite board games was Gomoku. I have lots of fond memories playing against family and friends in this simple yet satisfying game. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, I really began to feel the isolation from my friends and family. Inspired to combat this physical distance in my social circles, I decided to create an online version of Gomoku, allowing me to play against my family and friends no matter where they are located.

Although this may be a simple 2-player game, it holds a special place in my heart, and I hope that it will bring joy to anyone else who happens to use this game as a source of connection with others. :relaxed:

## :sparkles: Features

* **Interactive web game version of Gomoku**
	- Say good-bye to the days of physical stones and boards!   

* **Real-time, live multiplayer interactions**
	- With the help of socket.io, all moves played by one player will be immediately reflected on the other playerâ€™s screen. 
	- The goal is to make it feel like you are playing against your friend as if they were sitting right across from you. 

* **Join or create your own rooms** 
	- Easily create your own room with the automatic generation of a unique 6-digit code. 
	- Share this code with your desired friend/opponent using the built-in clipboard copy button.
	- Either player can start the game when both players have joined the room.

* **Individualized connections**
	- With the use of socket.io, the backend is able to send individualized information to each client. 
	- This ensures that each client receives only the information that they need to see, nothing more, nothing less.
